=============================

C++ Code written during the event to produce secret santa combinations from a file containing the full names of the participants. The Restrictions given were:

- Nobody must be paired with someone from their own family.
- Nobody can be paired with themselves.

Although our produced method was very extensible and could deal with large numbers of people, we ran out of time at the last minute. So unfortunately once people's secret santa had been chosen they were not removed from the list of possible recipients.
